  <h2>Hi, I’m Magnus</h2>
  <p>
    With 10+ years of experience in tech — from NTNU research labs to co-founding my own startup — I’ve seen projects
    from every angle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2017, I’ve been building with Ruby on Rails — internal tools, B2C platforms, and full-blown SaaS products.
    These days I’m CTO at <a href="https://midstay.com">Midstay</a>, leading a lean dev team and shipping under
    real-world pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    I care deeply about building <strong>clean, maintainable systems</strong> that scale, and I bring the same mindset
    to client work: move fast, but don’t cut corners.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m currently based in Indonesia, where I balance software and surf — building from one of the best remote work
    spots in the world.
