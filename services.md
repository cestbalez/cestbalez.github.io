## How I Work

Each project comes with a lightweight setup to keep things smooth and efficient:

- **Notion Project Hub** — A shared board for tracking progress, sharing updates, and communicating async.
- **Staging App (optional)** — I can set up a live staging environment for testing and validation.
- **GitHub Delivery** — All code delivered in a clean, production-ready repo, including documentation or Postman collections where relevant.
- **Clear Handoff** — I include deployment instructions and offer an optional onboarding call for your team.

Everything is scoped and managed to avoid surprises — no open-ended back-and-forth, just clean builds that ship.
