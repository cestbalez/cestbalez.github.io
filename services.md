<h2>Build With Confidence</h2>

<p>I help startups and product teams launch high-quality Rails projects quickly — without cutting corners. All services are fixed-scope, clearly priced, and delivered production-ready. Everything is designed to reduce risk and move fast — without sacrificing long-term maintainability.</p>

<p><strong>⚠️ Limited availability:</strong> I typically take on 1–2 projects per month to ensure quality and focus.</p> <!-- ADDED -->

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h4>How does payment work?</h4>
<p>All projects are fixed-price and paid 50% up front, 50% on delivery. Stripe or bank transfer available.</p>

<h4>What if I need something outside the scope?</h4>
<p>Additional features or changes can be quoted separately. I’ll always flag scope creep before it becomes a problem.</p>

<h4>Do you work with legacy Rails apps?</h4>
<p>No — I focus on greenfield projects or clearly scoped backends. I don’t work inside legacy codebases.</p>

<h4>Do you build React/SPA frontends?</h4>
<p>No. I use Rails with Hotwire, Turbo, and Tailwind to build fast, maintainable UIs without complex frontend stacks.</p>

<h4>Can you help after the project is done?</h4>
<p>Yes — I offer an optional maintenance plan for minor fixes and tweaks. Major changes can be scoped separately.</p>

<h4>Is it just you, or do you have a team?</h4>
<p>I lead every project personally. Sometimes I bring in trusted developers to support delivery — but I always own the outcome.</p>
