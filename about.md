Hey, and welcome to my collection of rambles on life, discovering your path and making it as an entrepreneur. Here, I share my experiences — both the highs and the struggles as I build a life on my own terms.

I'm here to share my experiences, struggles, thoughts and ideas with the world in an honest way. There’s so much value in learning from each other’s experiences, but for this to work, what we share shouldn’t be a means to an end, but rather the end itself. There's enough content out there that seems real, but which is actually just marketing in disguise. I want to challenge myself here, to be raw and free from agendas. In the past, I've struggled to find the confidence to speak my mind in public and to people I don't know very well, but this is a practice to change that.

We all go through tough patches in life, and if you choose a different path than most, you will likely face even more challenges. I know I have. However, someone has probably faced your current challenge, or something very similar. So if we can share the experiences with each other, we can all grow together. This is my attempt to connect with those who share my struggles and interests.

I’m 38 years old and originally from Norway. I mostly grew up there, though I spent several years abroad in my childhood. This clearly shaped who I am, and the choices I've made since then. Currently, I live in Lombok, Indonesia, and I'm working on designing and crafting the optimal life for *me* here. A big part of why I'm here is because I love surfing, but it's also because it's one of the best places in the world to build and design *your* life, or rebuild, which is what I've done over the last 7 years. My background is in Materials Science and Engineering, but in 2017, I made a major life shift—leaving the rat race, moving to Indonesia, and going all in on software. I’m now the co-founder and CTO of Midstay, and I’m also exploring solopreneurship on the side.

This blog is for those that want to find their own path in life. It's hard paving that way, finding who you truly are and building the life that you want. My path is focused on obtaining freedom. For me that means living wherever I want, working wherever and whenever I want, and being able to enjoy life in a way that's meaningful to *me*. If that resonates with you, this might be the place for you too.
