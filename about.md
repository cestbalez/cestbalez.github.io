## About Me

I'm Magnus — a technical founder, builder, and consultant helping startups ship solid software, fast. I'm currently CTO and co-founder of [Midstay](https://www.midstay.com), and I also take on selected client projects where I can add real value.

I specialize in building clean, scalable Rails applications — from API backends to full-stack tools with Hotwire. I work best with small teams and founders who value quality, structure, and getting things done without dragging it out.

Originally from Norway, I now live in Lombok, Indonesia. I moved here in 2017 to reshape how I live and work — combining deep, focused software work with a more intentional lifestyle. Outside of tech, I’m into meditation, philosophy, surf, running, and systems thinking — anything that helps me live and build with more clarity.

I write occasionally about these topics here: everything from building Rails tools to bootstrapping a business, to designing a life that works on your own terms.

## My Background

I started out in Materials Science and Engineering, with an MSc and a PhD track in aluminum alloys. But after realizing academia wasn’t the path for me, I made a full pivot — moved to Indonesia in 2017 and went all in on software.

I trained as a developer through a Rails-focused bootcamp and quickly moved into freelance work. After a few years building production systems as a backend engineer at a Norwegian scale-up, I co-founded Midstay — where I’ve led product and engineering ever since.

I’ve worked on internal tools, SaaS platforms, automation systems, and integration-heavy backends. I’m used to taking products from idea to launch, handling both technical architecture and hands-on development.

## What I’m Focused On

I currently split my time between Midstay and working with a few clients each quarter. My focus is on small, clearly scoped projects where I can deliver real impact — typically:

- MVPs or internal tools with business logic and admin flows  
- API microservices for automation, pricing, or integrations  
- Operations-focused tools for streamlining workflows

All projects come with a clear scope, async comms, and production-ready handoff.

## How I Work

I keep things lightweight and transparent:

- **Notion Project Hub** – For async updates and progress tracking  
- **Staging App (optional)** – For validation and internal testing  
- **Clean Handoff** – Code delivered in GitHub, with docs or Postman collections if relevant  
- **Optional onboarding** – I can walk your team through it if needed

My goal is to help you ship something solid — without unnecessary overhead.

## Why I Work Like This

I live in Lombok, Indonesia — a place that gives me the space to focus, stay active, and work deeply. I care about solving the right problems, building things that hold up, and collaborating with people who appreciate clarity and quality.

If that resonates, we’ll probably work well together.
